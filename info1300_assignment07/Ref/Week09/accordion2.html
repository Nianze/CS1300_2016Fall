          <div class="fable">
            <p>A WOLF who had a bone stuck in his throat hired a Crane, for a large
sum, to put her head into his mouth and draw out the bone. When the
Crane had extracted the bone and demanded the promised payment, the
Wolf, grinning and grinding his teeth, exclaimed: "Why, you have surely
already had a sufficient recompense, in having been permitted to draw
out your head in safety from the mouth and jaws of a wolf."</p>
            <p>In serving the wicked, expect no reward, and be thankful if you escape
injury for your pains.</p>

          <h3>Hercules and the Wagoner <span class="down">&darr;</span></h3>
          <div class="fable">
            <p>A CARTER was driving a wagon along a country lane, when the wheels sank
down deep into a rut. The rustic driver, stupefied and aghast, stood
looking at the wagon, and did nothing but utter loud cries to Hercules
to come and help him. Hercules, it is said, appeared and thus addressed
him: "Put your shoulders to the wheels, my man. Goad on your bullocks,
and never more pray to me for help, until you have done your best to
help yourself, or depend upon it you will henceforth pray in vain."</p>
            <p>Self-help is the best help.</p>

          <h3>The Hare and the Tortoise <span class="down">&darr;</span></h3>
          <div class="fable">
            <p>A HARE one day ridiculed the short feet and slow pace of the Tortoise,
who replied, laughing: "Though you be swift as the wind, I will beat you
in a race." The Hare, believing her assertion to be simply impossible,
assented to the proposal; and they agreed that the Fox should choose
the course and fix the goal. On the day appointed for the race the two
started together. The Tortoise never for a moment stopped, but went on
with a slow but steady pace straight to the end of the course. The Hare,
lying down by the wayside, fell fast asleep. At last waking up, and
moving as fast as he could, he saw the Tortoise had reached the goal,
and was comfortably dozing after her fatigue.</p>
            <p>Slow but steady wins the race.</p>
